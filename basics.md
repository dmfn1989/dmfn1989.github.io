#### **MAN Pages and Help Files**
Manual pages, also known as man pages, are simply reference manuals, most commonly used to understand the functionality of any given command. There are different categories that man pages fall into, depicted in the table below. 
<br>
Man pages can be accessed by typing <code> man ***command*** </code> , which will open them with the ***less*** manual pager. Additionally, most commands also have abbreviated help files that can be accessed by typing <code> ***command*** -h </code> **OR** <code> ***command*** --help </code> . 
<br>

**NOTE:** Since manual pages are opened with ***less***, you can initiate a test search by typing "/", as well as utilize any other functionality that ***less*** possesses.
